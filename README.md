# PPP-Loans

This project analyzes Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan data using Python to uncover trends in loan distribution, recipient industries, and geographic impact. It includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and visualization using libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, and Plotly. The goal is to provide insights into how federal relief funds were allocated during the COVID-19 pandemic and identify potential patterns or anomalies in loan disbursement.

Key Features:

- Efficient handling of large datasets

- Visual analysis of loan distributions by state, industry, and loan size

- Detection of potentially fraudulent or high-risk loan activity

- Interactive plots for intuitive data storytelling
